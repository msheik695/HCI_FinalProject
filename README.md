JAMO is an online fictioonal grocery store interface that was designed by Jake and Mohamed. This was a class project that shaped our understanding of web design and user experience.

To build this responsive grocery store, we used HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.

We implemented an autocomplete using JQuery user interface api to give the customers the power to search for items in the store.

The only functionalities in our website are the autocomplete search bar and display an alert whenever the user clicks on the "add to cart" button. The website is compatible with almost all devices; we implemented that using the media queries and grids in css.
