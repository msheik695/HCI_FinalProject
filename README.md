An online grocery store interface

A responsive grocery store built with HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.

We implemented an autocomplete using JQuery user interface api to give the customers the power to search for items in the store.

Source: https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/

The only functionalities in our website are the autocomplete search bar and display an alert whenever the user clicks on the "add to cart" button. 

Our website is compatible with almost all devices; we implemented that using the media queries in css. 

To align and organize the products, we used css grids.
